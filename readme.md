#atturbo555's osu! skins extension

This was a Twitch extension I made for a friend who made osu! skins and I really admired his work, so I created a Twitch extension that lists all of his skins. I stopped working on the extension since I stopped streaming.

I'm going to port this over to my website soon, and maybe rewrite it with a MongoDB database
